# Trump Sentiment Tracker

### Description
The Trump Sentiment Tracker uses real-time twitter data to determine the public's current perception of President Donald Trump. The web application streams all tweets containing the word 'Trump' within the last ten minutes of being launched. The tweets are then put through sentiment analysis in order to determine how postitive or negative they are. Lastly, the sentiment scores are averaged and reported to you using the visualization seen above. For best results, keep this tab open for a few minutes and then check it out.
